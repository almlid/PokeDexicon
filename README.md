# PokéDexicon

The **PokéDexicon** is a web-based Pokédex inspired by the classic Pokédex from the Pokémon games. Its primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and engaging encyclopedia for exploring detailed information about Pokémon.

Utilizes the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch up-to-date Pokémon information under the hood, ensuring that users have access to the latest data.

## Key Features

- Trainer to Pokémon **height/weight ratio calculators** with graphical displays.

- Interactive **Pokémon stats display** calculated with the well-documented [formula from Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stat#Formula).
